# Project Documentation
This document provides a comprehensive overview of the flashcard's frontend structure, technologies, and how to get started.

# Project Overview
This is a single-page application built with React and Vite, utilizing TypeScript for type safety. The project is structured to promote maintainability and scalability by separating concerns into logical directories for components, state management, and reusable logic.

# Project Structure
The project's source code is located in the src/ directory. The following is a breakdown of the key directories and files:

* assets/: This directory contains static assets such as images, fonts, and other media files used throughout the application.


* components/: Reusable, modular UI components are stored here. Each component should be self-contained and focused on a single responsibility.


* context/: This directory holds the application's React Context providers. These are used for managing global state that needs to be accessible by multiple components without prop drilling.


* DTOs/: Stands for "Data Transfer Objects." This folder is for defining TypeScript interfaces and types for data structures used in the application, ensuring type consistency and clarity.


* hooks/: Custom React hooks are defined here. These hooks encapsulate reusable logic, such as data fetching or form handling, making it easy to share functionality across components.


* layouts/: This directory contains components that define the overall page structure or layout. Examples include a main app layout with a header and footer.


* reducer/: This directory is dedicated to state management using the useReducer hook. It typically contains the reducer functions and initial state for complex state logic.

* App.tsx: The root component of the application. It typically contains the main layout and routes for different pages.

* main.tsx: The entry point for the application. It renders the App component into the DOM.


* .env: This file is used to store environment variables. 
  * Should contain VITE_BACKEND_BASE_URL

.gitignore: Specifies files and directories that Git should ignore.

vite-env.d.ts: TypeScript declaration file generated by Vite for type-checking environment variables.

### Getting Started
To get the project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```git clone https://github.com/MilkiyasGebru/hiring-milkiyas-gebru-flashcards.git```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```cd frontend```

3. Install dependencies:
Install the required packages.

```npm install```

4. Run the development server:

``` npm run dev ```



5. Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

- dev: Starts the development server.

- build: Compiles the application for production to the dist folder.

- lint: Lints the code using ESLint to identify and report on patterns found in the code.

- preview: Serves the production build locally.


Technologies Used
- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

- Vite: A build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.

- TypeScript: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
